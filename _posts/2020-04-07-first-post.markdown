Hello everyone! So what the heck is this blog even about you may ask. So I recently have been doing tons of projects on my free time, and need a way to document, share, and showcase my work! Here's a little list of a couple projects I have done recently.

- Discord bot that gets weather status's from openweathermap's api and posts them to discord.
- A Kubernetes cluster running on Raspberry Pi's.
- At home monitoring using Grafana, InfluxDB, and Telegraf.
- Chef cookbooks, and Ansible playbooks.
- A webscraper built in Python using Scrapy.
- A CI/CD Pipeline on CircleCi to deploy changes to a couple hosts using Ansible.

Do you enjoy learning? Or even reading about cool things like this? Look no further, This is the blog to follow! I plan to do weekly blog posts of my accomplishments, or lack-there-of, so stay tuned!
