### Update

What have I been doing this past week? Well I've been busy making a fishing forecast
application that is based on solunar events. So whats that mean? Fish tend to be more
active during, sunrise and sunset, moonrise and moonset, and different phases of the moon.
So I will be able to give a good time frame of when the best time of day to fish would be
in a specific region. :fish:

Lets have a discussion in the comments below. What is your favorite Linux OS and why?

---

### Ubuntu LTS

We are nearing the corner for Ubuntu's new Long Term Support release this month.
Well actually it is this coming week, April 23rd! While this doesn't affect me much,
as I am not an avid Ubuntu user, this operating system has been very popular to those
who are just getting started with Linux. This Debian based OS has some pretty sweet features,
and offers support for 5+ years on their releases. Bionic Beaver (Ubuntu 18.04)
is supported for 10 years. This gives businesses a great Open Source desktop operating system
for their teams to use. Also, manufacturing companies can take advantage of such a 
long support cycle, much like Windows, and ship Ubuntu on Laptops and Desktops much like
we have seen with Lenovo and Dell.

So anyway, whats my take on this new OS? Well the thing I found cool was the support
for Livepatch for updating your kernel without rebooting! It ships with Kernel 5.4
and has all the latest tools by default, like: Python3.8, Php7.4, OpenJDK11, and even
Golang1.13. This will help sell to the Developer crowd. Not much has changed besides
the baked in Darkmode that everyone loves, and some software updates.

### Fedora 32!

We are also near the release of Fedora 32! Now this is more my speed, as I enjoy
Fedora much more than Ubuntu :beer:. Fedora will also be shipped with many of those sick software
updates like Ubuntu, so we won't go over them much. But we will now have Kernel 5.6 unlike
Ubuntu's 5.4 release. While I am not a huge fan of the Gnome Desktop, Fedora, unlike
its Debian based competitor, offers different desktop environments with it's Fedora Spins.
Oh yeah, it also offers ARM based OS's for Raspberry Pi's! [Fedora Arm](https://arm.fedoraproject.org/prerelease)


But one thing that Linux is lacking in the desktop
world is the support for gaming. Actually it is not that Linux does not support it.
It is that gaming companies are not very willing to port their software from a DirectX environment to an 
OpenGL environment for such a small user base. While I write this blog on an Open Source
operating system, the harsh reality of it all is, I too, am a Windows user... :sad:

### Docker Compose

So [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/awesome-compose) is now available for anyone to contribute to!
This is really cool because it will be developed as an Open Source standard. This may mean
we will be seeing Docker Compose used with Kubernetes based applications. While Docker
already offers it's Docker Swarm, lets face it, many production environments don't use it.
The industry favors Kubernetes. One downside of this is, while you are still using Docker (most likely)
for your containers, you are using Kubernetes to orchestrate them. So you have access
to Docker Compose but can not utilize it on Kubernetes. This may change, making 
Kubernetes a little easier to use.

### OpenStack

Yup! It's that time of year. OpenStack releases it's new 6 month release next month.

I don't even wanna go there....
