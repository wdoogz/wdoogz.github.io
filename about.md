      I am a twenty-something year old duderoni from the hills of central PA! (Yes near the little league world series)
      I am an alumni of The University of Pittsburgh at Bradford, Class of 2019.
      I love to fish, ride fourwheelers, drink a few craft beers, and simply create things! A true engineer at hear :)

  What do I do?

<p>  <div class="manual-content">

      Currently I am an `Operations Engineer` at Verzion Media. I work under the Communications and Publishing side of things. I love to automate anything I have to do more than one time. I do _a_ _lot_ of side projects at home to further my knowledge on this vast industry.

      I graduated with a Bachelors degree in `Computer Information Systems and Technology`
      I also received minors in the following:
      - `Network and Systems Administration`
      - `Management Information Systems`
      - `Cyber Security and Digital Forensics`
