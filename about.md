<p>  <div class="manual-content">
      I am a twenty-something year old duderoni from the hills of central PA! (Yes near the little league world series)
      I am an alumni of The University of Pittsburgh at Bradford, Class of 2019.
      I love to fish, ride fourwheelers, play guitar, drink a few craft beers, and simply create things! :)

<p>  <div class="manual-content">

      Currently I am an `Operations Engineer` at Verzion Media. I work under the Communications and Publishing side of things. I love to automate anything I have to do more than one time. I do a lot of side projects at home to further my knowledge on this vast industry.<br /><br />

      I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Computer Information Systems and Technology<br />
      I also received minors in the following:<br />
      &nbsp;- Network and Systems Administration<br />
      &nbsp;- Management Information Systems<br />
      &nbsp;- Cyber Security and Digital Forensics<br /><br />
